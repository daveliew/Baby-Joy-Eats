# SEI-30 Project 2 - Baby Joy Eats (Meal Plan Creator)

I am building a meal planner for my daughter, Joy. I hope it'll help you and your Little One too! 
I was inspired to build a Trello-like UI and used the react-beautiful-dnd library from noneother than the Atlassian folks themselves.
I learnt how to control state using Dispatch and context, and how to fetch items based on state changes.
